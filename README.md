# Heart Rate Tracker via Camera

## Overview

This Python application utilizes Flask to create a camera-based heart rate monitoring system. Inspired by the study [A Remote Photoplethysmography-Based Heart Rate Monitoring System Using a Low-Cost Camera: A Preliminary Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126755/), it explores the use of subtle facial cues to estimate pulse rates remotely.

## Project Description

The objective of this tool is to track a user's heart rate through their facial appearance using a regular camera. It capitalizes on minor, visually undetectable skin tone fluctuations that correspond with blood flow. By applying spatial and temporal processing to the video input, the system highlights these subtle changes, enabling heart rate estimation.

## Features

* **Non-Invasive Pulse Detection:** The system identifies heart rate by capturing minimal color variations in facial skin using a camera—no physical contact required.

* **Advanced Video Processing:** Combines spatial filtering and time-based analysis to enhance visual signals linked to heartbeat-induced skin changes.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection via Camera:** The user faces the camera while live video is recorded.

2. **Analyzing Skin Color Fluctuations:** The system examines subtle shifts in skin coloration that align with blood flow cycles.

3. **Signal Amplification:** The captured video undergoes spatial and temporal filtering to strengthen these faint signals.

4. **Heart Rate Computation:** The enhanced data is analyzed to determine the user’s heart rate.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-rate-tracker.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Then, open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to begin using the tool.

## Usage Guide

* Launch the app in your preferred browser.
* Grant camera access when prompted.
* Sit facing the camera so your face is clearly visible.
* The system will analyze the video feed and display your real-time heart rate.
